# Exercises - Chapter 11 - LINQ

## Exercise 1

The start solution for this exercise contains 3 projects:
* **LinqExamples**: a class library in which you will have to implement some methods.
* **LinqExamples.Tests**: an NUnit test project that tests the classes in the *LinqExamples* class library.
* **Guts.Tests**: a test project that checks the correctness of your solution.

Look at the unit tests in the **LinqExamples.Tests** project. 
Your job is to **make all the tests green** by implementing the method that is being tested.
Analyse the tests to figure out what the behavior of the tested method should be. 
Start with the tests in *1_SelecetExamplesTests.cs*.
End with the tests in *5_JoinExamplesTests.cs*.

It is allowed (recommended) to read and inspect the tests in *LinqExamples.Tests*, but you may not alter them. 
Its also forbidden, of course, to alter the tests in *Guts.Tests*

You **must use LINQ** to make the tests green. 
It is forbidden to use loops (for, foreach, while) when you implement the methods.
